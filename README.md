## What?

This is a basic **task management web app** where you can:

- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks

It's fully functional and ideal for beginners learning web development with Python.

## How?

The app is built using the following technologies:

- **Flask**: lightweight Python web framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interaction
- **HTML/CSS**: for the frontend
- **SQLite**: default database (easily replaceable)

You can run the app locally with:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flask-Todo-App.git
cd Flask-Todo-App
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies and Run the app

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Then open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Why?

I created this project to:

- Practice building a full-stack web application using Flask
- Understand how routing, templating, and database integration work in Flask
- Get hands-on experience with CRUD operations
- Build a solid foundation before working on more advanced Python web projects
